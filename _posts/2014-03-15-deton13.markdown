In the article you can find the research of distribution of explosion gases. 
The status of researches of the hydrotamping was examined.   The new function mode was 
suggested. The laboratory researches of the hydrotamping was discribed. The laboratory 
researches of dispersion of  detonating products were showed.  The construction of 
bush in a blast-hole changing the direction of movement of gases was 
described here. The new construction of the blast-hole charge was suggested. The 
most effective ways of increasing the efficiency of  explosive works was underlined 
in that work.  The results of using of bushes and hydrotamping in real conditions 
was described here.
